# Ordivon Gateway

Thin, non-authoritative northbound MCP adapter over Ordivon natural owners.

Gateway owns only:
- stable public action names;
- capability projection;
- owner routing;
- request/response compatibility;
- correlation/reference normalization.

**Capability-routing LEGO (B01):** `routes=None` selects the default catalog,
whereas an explicitly supplied empty route map is an intentional no-capability
configuration. Every route entry must be a `CapabilityRoute` whose
`capability` exactly matches its map key. The adapter must reject mismatches,
rather than advertising one capability while dispatching another. Native
contract tests: `tests/test_gateway_service.py` route-identity and explicit
empty-routes cases. This is Gateway projection validation, not authorization to
execute any Runtime or Host effect.

Gateway never owns Runtime Job/Attempt truth, Host continuity truth, Harness run truth, OAuth/credential authority, Plugin/Skill semantics, or domain completion.


### Source boundaries

- **Capability Catalog** (src/ordivon_gateway/capability_catalog.py):
  read-only system description, capability description, search and resolution.
  Observes natural owners; never executes effects or claims domain completion.
  Reuses the canonical capability_projection.project_execution_capability operator.
- **Gateway application facade** (src/ordivon_gateway/service.py):
  stable public signatures, execution dispatch, artifact reads and Host delegation.
  Its discovery methods delegate rather than duplicating catalog rules.
- **Owner protocol** (src/ordivon_gateway/owner_protocol.py):
  owner response validation and configuration probes. The canonical execution
  reference grammar stays in execution_refs.py; the service.py compatibility
  import of parse_execution_ref remains available.

Dependencies point from service to capability_catalog and owner_protocol;
capability_catalog itself depends on owner_protocol, not on service. Catalog
inputs are the owner caller, copied route map, optional external-worker
projection and timeout. Extraction preserves the public route and JSON
contracts. Behavioral tests establish observed compatibility, not proof
of implementation-level semantic equivalence.

**Execution cancellation identity contract (Gateway B01 / Runtime owner):** the
`execution.cancel` adapter forwards the exact Runtime Job identity from the
northbound operation reference. Before returning an `ExecutionReceipt`, it
must reject a `job.cancel` response identifying any different Job. The same
rule applies to the Linux and Windows Runtime owners; see
`tests/test_gateway_service.py::test_execution_cancel_rejects_mismatched_runtime_job_identity`.
This validates result correlation, not physical process termination or a new
cancellation authority.

B01 is intentionally small. The public schema avoids fast-moving closed enums such as Runtime execution-context values. Provider-owned context data stays opaque at the Gateway boundary; Gateway only lowers the generic envelope into the owner field and leaves semantic validation to the owner.

For `execution.windows`, Gateway 0.4 accepts either the legacy provider-defined string context or a provider-defined JSON object. A string is forwarded as Runtime `windowsAuthority`; an object is forwarded unchanged as Runtime `windowsContext`. Capability projection prefers Runtime `windowsContexts` when the owner advertises them, so identity/privilege composition remains Runtime-owned rather than duplicated in Gateway.


## Host northbound boundary

The default external Plugin connects only to Gateway. Gateway exposes normal Host continuity and collaboration actions through stable northbound names while Host remains the semantic owner.

- continuity get/list/observe and adopt/checkpoint/attention (compatibility)
- continuity find/changes (preferred discovery/change vocabulary; mechanical recency only)
- collaboration list/search/post (compatibility)
- collaboration publish (preferred write vocabulary; explicit global or continuity scope)

Gateway currently exposes `host.status` as a delegated, read-only Host status/integrity observation compatibility Tool. Host owns the returned status and evidence; Gateway does not become Host administration or Doctor/recovery authority. The released `mcp-surface.json` and installed MCP SDK surface determine current Tool availability; source registration alone does not prove deployment.

Checkpoint payloads are opaque objects at the Gateway boundary. Host validates the current WorkingCheckpoint schema; Gateway does not maintain a second Host checkpoint ontology.

## External pull workers (candidate R3)

Gateway can optionally enable the provider-neutral external pull-worker transport by setting
ORDIVON_GATEWAY_EXTERNAL_WORKER_DB to a durable SQLite path. When enabled, enrolled workers
contribute their current operator-bounded capabilities to the normal Gateway capability
projection and execution.submit/get/cancel plus artifact.read remain the northbound API.

Worker HTTP routes live under /v1/workers/* and /v1/operations/*. Runtime requests are
Ed25519 signed and replay-fenced. Enrollment is disabled unless
ORDIVON_GATEWAY_WORKER_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN_FILE is configured.

This transport is execution-delivery mechanics only. It does not close Admission Fabric
AF-S2 capability authorization, does not establish domain EffectAuthority, and does not
grant shell workers browser authority.

The external worker's SQLite transport must establish a readable persisted
operation before committing a submit, terminal completion or cancellation.
If the post-write readback fails, it rolls back the entire transaction,
including attempt and artifact changes; this never counts as an executed or
semantically completed effect. Owner-native fault injection and the
`python -O` negative control live in
`tests/test_external_worker_precommit_readback.py`.

## Capability observation lifecycle

Independent read-only Runtime and Host capability observations run concurrently, once per required owner per request. Projection ordering stays deterministic, and observations are not cached across requests. A failed or timed-out owner observation remains UNKNOWN through the existing observation error; healthy owners remain visible.

The default per-probe cooperative cancellation budget is five seconds. Cancellation waits for transport cleanup: legacy MCP session DELETE cleanup may extend that budget, so it is not a hard end-to-end latency deadline. Cancellation of the enclosing request drains its child probes. Gateway does not parallelize effects or retry upstream effects.

### Windows local service identity

The Windows candidate can optionally bind `LocalServiceBearerTokenFile` while preserving
`TrustCfAccess`. Keep the candidate stopped, materialize all configured owner credentials
together with `CreateLocalServiceBearer`, and activate using the resulting receipt.
The generated local identity is separate from upstream Runtime credentials, protected
for SYSTEM, Administrators and the Gateway service SID, and accepted only on loopback.
Never print token contents or credential receipt digests. Existing profiles without the
optional field retain their activation contract. This local acceptance lane does not
qualify the public Cloudflare principal, Linux/Skills bindings or public promotion.

Native Windows identity tests require an installed, stopped
`OrdivonGatewayCandidateR5` service so its service SID can be resolved. Linux runs
skip these Windows-only checks; those skips are not native Windows qualification.

Windows release dependencies use uv `--link-mode copy`: each release owns its file ACLs independently of the shared package cache. Existing releases are not rewritten by reinstall; repair a qualified stopped release separately and retain its recovery backup.
